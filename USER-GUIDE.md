## System Overview: Online vs Offline Operations

**CleanOps is designed with two distinct operational modes:**

### üè¢ **Managers & Office Staff - Online Operations**
- Operate from office environments with reliable internet
- Real-time job creation, assignment, and monitoring
- Live dashboard with current job statuses and worker locations
- Im### Mobile App Usage (Mobile-First Design)

### Offline Functionality for Mobile Field Workers

The CleanOps mobile app is mobile-first, optimized for smartphones and tablets used by field workers in areas with poor or no internet connectivity:te access to payroll, reporting, and analytics
- **Requires internet connection for all functionality**

### üöê **Field Workers - Offline-First Operations**  
- Designed for cleaning sites with poor/no internet connectivity
- Download jobs and instructions when connected (office, depot, WiFi)
- Work completely offline for hours or days
- All features work without internet: time tracking, photos, task completion

## Mobile App Usage

### Offline Functionality for Field Workers

The CleanOps mobile app is specifically designed for field workers who need to operate in areas with poor or no internet connectivity:

1. **Download Jobs**: Jobs and tasks sync automatically when online (before leaving office/depot)
2. **Work Completely Offline**: Complete all tasks, take photos, record time without any internet connection
3. **Automatic Sync**: Data uploads automatically when connection restored (return to office, find WiFi, or cellular signal)
4. **GPS Tracking**: Location tracking works offline using device GPS - no data connection required
5. **Extended Offline Periods**: Can work for days offline without any functionality loss
6. **Manager Updates**: Managers see progress updates when workers sync, not real-time during offline periods

### Photo Management

#### Best Practices for Photos:
- **Before Photos**: Capture overall area condition
- **During Photos**: Document process and any issues
- **After Photos**: Show completed work and results
- **Detail Shots**: Close-ups of specific cleaning results

#### Mobile Photo Requirements:
- Minimum resolution: 1080p (optimized for mobile cameras)
- Include timestamp and location
- Clear, well-lit images
- Multiple angles for large areas
- Touch-to-focus for sharp images
- Mobile-optimized compression for faster upload

### Battery and Data Management for Field Workers

- **Battery Optimization**: App designed for all-day battery life during offline operation
- **Data Usage**: Minimal data usage, photos upload on WiFi by default to conserve mobile data
- **Background Sync**: Continues syncing even when app is closed (when connected)
- **Offline Storage**: Up to 50MB local storage for extended offline operations
- **Smart Sync**: Prioritizes critical data first when connection becomes available
- **Data Conservation**: Managers work online, workers sync when convenient/connected
